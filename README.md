## **1. Introduction**:
For my Master Thesis at TU Delft (faculty of Technology, Policy & Management, program: Complex Systems Engineering & Management) I analysed cascading failures initialised in the communication network. I developed an interdependent communication network and power grid. The communication network is created using NetworkX library and pandapower is used to create the power grid.

## **2. The model**:
   The description of the model can be found in the Master Thesis Document

   
   
## **3. Installation**:
   The model is created in a Juypter Notebook vers. 7.0.8,  We used Python vers. 3.9.18 through Anaconda.

## **4. Usage**:
When opening the notebook file, there is short description on how to run each cell (which sequence)
